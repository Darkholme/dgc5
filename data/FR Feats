Shadow Magic
Prerequisite: Shadowborn (Shade)
Your darkvision increases to a radius of 120 feet and magical
darkness no longer impedes your darkvision. In addition, you
have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to
discern illusions.
You also can call upon the power of shadow to cast the
following spells a combination of four times with this ability:
darkness, invisibility, mirror image, and misty step (up to 60
feet). You regain the ability to cast these spells when you
finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.
