Admixture Spell

When you cast a spell that deals fire, lightning, cold, or

acid damage you can expend 1 sorcery point to convert

half of the damage to fire, lightning, cold, or acid damage.

Artillery Spell

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater,

you can expend 2 sorcery points to increase the range to

1000 feet. The spell takes effect at the beginning of your

next turn.

Formless Spell

When you cast a spell with duration of instantaneous and

an area of cone, cylinder, sphere, or cube, you can expend

1 sorcery point to choose a new shape. The new shape can

be a cone, cylinder, sphere, or cube of the original

dimension. For cylinders, the height equals the radius.

When converting from a cone, use half the original

dimension.

Non-Lethal Spell

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell,

you can expend 1 sorcery point to cause the creature to be

unconscious and stable instead of dying or dead. Non-
Lethal Spell cannot stop a creature from being killed

outright unless the cause of outright death is damage (ex.

Disintegration, Power Word: Kill, etc.).

Persisting Spell

When you cast a spell that requires concentration you can

expend 1 sorcery point. You gain a +5 bonus on checks

made to remain concentrating on the spell.

Piercing Spell

When you cast a spell that deals damage you can expend

sorcery points equal to the spell level (1 for cantrips) to

ignore targeted creaturesâ€™ damage resistances or

immunities.

Zombifying Spell

When you kill at least one creature with a spell, you can

expend 4 sorcery points to cause one creature slain by the

spell to rise as zombies under your control (as animate

dead) for the next minute. You can expend additional

sorcery points to animate additional slain creatures.
